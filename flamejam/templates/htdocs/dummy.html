				<h2>What is a gamejam?</h2>

				<p>A game jam is an event during which all participants create games according to a provided theme
					within a short amount of time (usually between two days to a week). Check out the rules page for
					details on the procedure. </p>

				<h2>Who can participate?</h2>

				<p>Everyone who is at least 18 years old.</p>

				<h2>What type of games are created?</h2>

				<p>Difficult to say. We want to achieve a wide range of different game types. Games are also rated for
					their innovative factor, and some games submitted have unique gameplay mechanisms. Of course there
					are always some games of the main video game genres, but that depends on the theme and the
					creativity of the authors.<br>
					&nbsp;<br>
					Have the courage to try something completely new. It's worth it!</p>

				<h2>How do I make a game?</h2>

				<p>Never did it before? No problem! The game jams are a learning effort, so newbies are also welcome.
					But to make sure you will have something playable within this short amount of time you should
					prepare for the event. Tips for greenhorns:<br>
					&nbsp;<br>
					For programmers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First learn programming, then game development. Many people think this is the same, but actually
						there is a huge difference. It's good to know how to program, but making a game is much more.
						You also need art, maths, a story, a lot of creativity and a good time management.
					</li>
					<li>Find an easy programming language, framework or engine. You probably do not want to start of
						coding C on OpenGL level.
					</li>
					<li>Find something that suits you. You are even allowed to use game creation software where you only
						have to drag 'n' drop your components together.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For everyone:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Team up! While working with other people who are more experienced than you you learn a lot
						faster than alone. There are lots of skilled game developers here, just ask.
					</li>
					<li>Join as an artist. Every game needs some art, and every programmer loves artists. You will
						contribute an important part to a game project, even if you don't write a single line of code.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Where can I find resources?</h2>

				<p>We compiled this nice list for you. But always make sure to check the licence!</p>

				<h2>I need an artist / programmer</h2>

				<p>You can find other participants onsite or on this website. We will do a idea pitch after the theme
					announcement and try to connect everyone with a existing or a new team. Feel free to ask us anywhere
					and anytime if you need support.</p>
